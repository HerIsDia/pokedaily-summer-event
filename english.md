# It's summer time! ☀️

In less than a week it's summer, and with the future release of Pokedailyv2 later this year, for this summer, there's now a little something for you: **a summer event.**

Yes, in the teaser of pokedailyv2, I've tease than events will be a thing, and while the event is based on the actual website and version of pokedaily, there will be some events even **before** the release of the v2.

### So, now, there's the event!

This is summer, you've decided than being a Pokemon all these days are enough and you wanna be a pokemon trainer and go on vacation to Paldea and bring with you a team of 6 pokemons. **Well, what team will you have this summer ?**

### Art contest!

I know there's some artists here, and I wanna do a little challenge for you!

Make an art of you (an OC or your fursona, or draw yourself) and all of your team than the website give you, having a great time somewhere on Paldea in your vacation. (It can be in the wilds, on a city, in the academy even if you're on vacation, on the beach...)

### Dates, info and link.

- The event, art contest and the website will be on from today up to the 28st August.
- The art contest is not necessary, I just found it fun to propose one if someone wanna try it. There's no competition and will not have any rewards. Just have fun if you wanna do it. (and if nobody will do it, it's okay.)

So, let's go see what team of Pokemon you'll have this summer: https://summer.pokedaily.heris.app/
